# TBI-HRV-Prediction
Predicting mortality risk in TBI patients using HRV data
Early and accurate prediction of mortality risk in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) is essential for improving clinical decision-making, optimizing resource allocation, and ultimately reducing patient mortality. This study focuses on leveraging heart rate variability (HRV) features extracted from the first 24 hours of electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings to predict mortality risk.

To enhance predictive accuracy, we propose a hybrid deep learning model that integrates a weight predictor with a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network. The weight predictor assigns importance to key HRV features, while the BiLSTM unit effectively captures temporal dependencies within the HRV sequences. This combination enables the model to learn meaningful patterns in the physiological data, improving overall mortality risk prediction performance.
