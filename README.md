# TBI-HRV-Prediction
Predicting mortality risk in TBI patients using HRV data
Accurate early mortality risk prediction for traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) is crucial for optimizing patient care, allocating resources effectively, and reducing mortality rate. 
This project presents an approach to predict mortality risk for TBI patients using analysis of heart rate variability derived from the first 24 hours of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. 
A deep learning model, referred to as a hybrid model, was developed by integrating a weight predictor with a bidirectional long-short-term memory (BiLSTM) unit. 
This hybrid architecture enhances predictive performances by weighting features and capturing patterns in HRV data.
